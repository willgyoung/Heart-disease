# Heart-disease EDA

#### This was a dataset I pulled off of the Kaggle website on heart disease. It looked at factors before an exercise test, during the exercise test, and after the exercise test. Originally the data had over 76 different attributes, but was preprocessed before I started working with it to include 14 of the most important attributes. 

#### After going through the dataset there were about 6 different factors that allowed a full diagnosis to be determined.
